# Describes connectivity required by end systems.
# It's used to create subnets, VLANs and routed information in leafs
# Simplified version, stretched VLANs are not supported.
# Subnets are globally unique but VLANs are locally unique (per LEAF)
# vEOS has a limited number of ports, only one VLAN is assigend to a port
